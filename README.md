Docker

Docker:
	Docker is an open-source platform that is like a toolkit for creating and running something called containers. If we have an app, and it needs specific files, settings, and tools to run properly. Docker packages all of that into a container, so the app runs the same way anywhere whether it’s on our computer, someone else’s, or a big server in the cloud.

How docker works:
	Docker works by using called containers. These are lightweight packages that hold everything an app needs to run its code, settings, and libraries. Instead of installing apps directly on your computer, you run them inside containers.

Why we using docker:
	Docker solves a lot of problems developers face. In the case the application working on a computer, but sharing with other that doesn’t work on others. In this case, the docker sharing the code, settings, libraries with the container. So, the application works well on the others computer.

Where we use docker:
	We can use Docker from anywhere, Developers use it to set up coding environments, run tests, and deploy apps. Companies use Docker in production to host websites, services, and databases.

Who Uses Docker:
	Developers are using docker to share their application with others, so they sharing their application settings, codes, frameworks with their teammates. System administrators use it to manage servers and apps.

When we using docker:
	Docker is good for many scenarios. Use it when we building an app, especially if it depends on specific tools or libraries. It’s used for sharing projects because it works the same everywhere.
